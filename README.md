emvc is a framework that brings structure and MVC patterns to web
applications using [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

    $ npm install emvc

## Quick Start

`emvc`, the command line interface to emvc, can be used to generate a
starter application.  To use it, install emvc globally.

    $ npm install emvc -g

Next, create an application and install dependencies.

    $ emvc create hello
    $ cd hello
    $ npm install

Start the server.

    $ emvc server

The application is available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Start the server with node debug mode

	$ emvc server --debug (node --debug mode)
	$ emvc server --debug-brk (node --debug-brk mode)

Then you can use debug tools like [node-inspector](https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector) to debug your application as usual.

## Guide

The [emvc Guide](http://emvcjs.org/guide/) is the official source
for documentation, and is a handy reference to have available when developing
web applications powered by emvc.
